This program can be launched with those two commands
mvn clean package | 
mvn exec:java 


Program behaviour:

The game is simulated by instantiating a Game object which has a list of bots as an argument.
The number of players can vary from 1 to 4.

The standard output shows the win, lose, and tie percentage as well as the average score for each bot, for a total of 1000 games.
You can also activate the display of game details on each turn.

Two parts are launched automatically:

The first part is composed of a Parcel Bot, a Panda Bot, an Intelligent Bot and a Random Bot
The second part consists of two Intelligent Bot

These parts do not display game details.

The tests cover 91% of the lines of code.
